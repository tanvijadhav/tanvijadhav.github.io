      <h4>About Me</h4>

      <p>I am a Research and Development Engineer at <b><a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a></b> where I am a part of the <b><a href="https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">WCSNG group</a></b>, advised by <b><a href="https://dineshb-ucsd.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Dinesh Bharadia</a></b>. I am currently working on developing a Self-Supervised Machine Learning model which together with radar sensing can make autonomous driving better.
      

      <p>My research interest is in improving the mathematical understanding of modern machine learning - including problems like generalization in DNNs, training dynamics, the very good performance of optimization algorithms in non-convex settings and the kind of features learnt by these algorithms. I want to employ both theoretical and empirical methods to this end.</p>
      
      <p>Previously, I was a Systems Engineer at <b><a href="https://kumunetworks.com/" target="_blank">Kumu Networks</a></b> where I worked on the design, implementation and testing of Self Intereference Cancellation (SLIC) algorithms to enable Full Duplex Communication. Before that, I completed my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with communications systems as my major in May 2019 at the <b><a href="https://umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a></b>. While at Michigan, my research focus was on Network Information Theory, where I was characterizing the finite block length of the codes used in a communication-co-operation setting. I was fortunate to be advised by <b><a href="https://pradhan.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">Prof. S. Sandeep Pradhan</a></b>.</p> 

      <p>And before that, I completed my B.E.(Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from <b><a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus</a></b>, India in 2017, where I worked on a wide variety of research projects including ones on optical communications, Wireless Sensor Networks and Visible Light Communication </p>

      <p>Please find my CV <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BbaWJMJl4o7eT52tJUtrAQZF7Ea5ockR/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></b> and my Google Scholar page <b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TEDFaoAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">here</a></b>.</p>
